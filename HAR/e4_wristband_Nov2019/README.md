11/24/2019 e4 data collection, processing updated June 2021.  Lee B. Hinkle, Texas State University

Data collected using e4 wristband https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/ for the 6 activities in the WISDM data set https://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php  

Data was collected in 3 separate structured runs of approximately 6 minutes each and a unstructured walk. The e4 was worn on the right wrist and was removed after run/walk to check data.

Sessions were video recorded using an action camera strapped to upper arm facing downward.  Session numbers are from the Empatica.com/connect site and are different from the name of the matching zip file.

The plots directory has screengrabs from the e4 connect site for each of the four files.
